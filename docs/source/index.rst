Welcome to the documentation of the Kodo C bindings.

Kodo is a C++ library for implementing Erasure Correcting Codes, in particular
Network Codes. The C bindings provide high-level access to the basic
functionality provided by Kodo, such as encoding and decoding data with
various codecs. The examples folder provides sample applications showing the
usage of the C API.
